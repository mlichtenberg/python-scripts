These scripts require a number of Python libraries related to data analysis and
scientific computing, including:

    pandas
    matplotlib
    numpy
    scikit-learn

These scripts have been tested with Python 3.6.

The "pandas" scripts are used to analyze and clean a data set.
The "scikit" scripts are used to split the data set into training and test sets,
and to train and test machine learning models.

The easiest way to obtain all of the necessary libraries is to install the 
"anaconda" Python distribution.  This is a specialized distribution for data 
analysis and scientific computing.  The main downside to "anaconda" is that it
is a large distribution, and will install quite a bit more than what is strictly
required for these scripts.
